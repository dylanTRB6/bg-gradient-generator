# CSS Background Gradient Generator

This is a simple tool for generating background gradient colors to be used for CSS. Users can use two color inputs to choose the colors of the gradient, or they can click the random button to generate a random color gradient. At the moment, only linear gradients going from left to right are supported.

To-do:
- add support for different directions
- add support for different angles
- add support for more colors
- add support for color hints
- add support for radial gradients
- add support for conic gradients
